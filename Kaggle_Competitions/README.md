# Introduction

Kaggle competitions are machine learning tasks made by Kaggle or other companies like Google or WHO. If you compete successfully, you can win real money prizes.

Competitions range in types of problems and complexity. You can take part in one even if youâ€™re a beginner. However, advanced competitions are much more interesting, and a leading place in a competition is a great addition to your machine learning engineer resume.

Competitions are held in three different formats.

## Simple Competitions

These are your standard Kaggle competitions. You access data, build a model, make a submission. Then, your results are checked by the hosts of the competition and you are attributed a score on the leaderboard. The majority of competitions on Kaggle follow this format.

## Two-stage Competitions

In two-stage competitions, every challenge has two parts. Stage 2 offers a new test dataset that is released at the start of the stage. To access it, you have to make a submission at stage 1. To participate in such competitions successfully, you need to read the rules carefully and keep an eye on the timeline.

## Code Competitions

In code competitions, submissions are made from inside of a Kaggle Notebook (we explain later on what it is). These competitions, in a way, are fairer because all the users have the same hardware. Code competitions may have constraints on the Notebooks you can submit, for example, CPU or GPU runtime, ability to use external data, and access to the internet. So reading the rules here is also very important.

In Kaggle competitions, everyone competes in teams of one or more people. Every team must have a team leader. You can invite your friends or join a team of other users via the Team tab in the competition. Your team can also merge with another team, for example, if you realize that submitting a model on your own is too challenging. However, you can only do it until a certain deadline.
